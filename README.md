Missile Command by Hariharan Ramshankar
CSC 561 @ NCSU-Final Project

Implemented with THREE.js
The game objective is to destroy incoming missiles using your own missiles fired from 3 different batteries.
Use the keys A,S,D to fire from the left, middle and right batteries respectively.
The mouse pointer position will represent the location to which the fired missile will travel before detonating.
The R key will reload the game.
A spaceship will appear suddenly at times for bonus points!
Note, you will get a health and ammo refill at every level to make the game enjoyable.
Missile speed will rise quickly in later levels though.
There is a game over screen and a victory condition too.
Songs change per level, so be prepared for a fun experience!!

The sound files included are a few different rock songs from YouTube. All rights belong to the original creators of the songs.
The missile and anti-missile models were downloaded from https://free3d.com/3d-model/sm-2-missile-defense--51283.html and https://free3d.com/3d-model/agm-114-hell-fire-17444.html respectively.
The missile command logo was created in Blender by me.
